# Arduino-Potentiometer
Level-2-- Write a program that displays the following color sequence on the RGB LED (D9-D11) Red, Green, Blue. 
The speed at which the color changes is controlled by Rotation dial A0 on the board. As you turn the dial the speed of the RGB changes.
Level-3-- Use the rotation sensor to cycle through the colours of the rainbow. (ROYGBP) depending on the value of the rotation sensor. (exL 0-150 = red from 150-300= Orange)
Level-4-- Create a code that asks the user to input a pattern of colours using R, G or B. Then display that sequence of colours. You can choose to always have it the same length. 
Ex: Please input 10 colours, or you can choose to have the user simply stop. You can assume that they will not use other letters.
